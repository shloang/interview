# Interview task
Box factory assembles boxes out of wooden panels.
 Each panel has a rectangular form. Width and height of a panel are represented by integer numbers. Factory receives an order to  produce a box of a given volume (an integer number again). Chief engineer has a catalog of available panels stored as an array of (width, height) pairs. Your job is to select the cheapest set of three panels that will produce a box of the requested volume. Price of a panel is proportional to it's area. 
For example, given a panel list [(2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 5), (1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 4), (2, 5)] and a volume 12, you should return panels [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 3)]
